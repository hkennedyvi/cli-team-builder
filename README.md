# CLI Team Builder

This CLI application allows its user to easily create an html file that displays a devloper team.

Upon running, a company manager is guided through a series of prompted questions to gather data on themselves as well as a group of employees consisiting of interns and engineers.

Each member will be asked to provide information specific to their position. 

Ultimately, a unqiue HTML document will be written that fills in profession cards for each team member.
